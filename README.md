# WorldHappiness-Python

**Data Source**

The dataset originates from Kaggle and corresponds to the World Happiness Report 2021, utilizing data sourced from the Gallup World Poll. It includes happiness scores and rankings. Additionally, 

**Data Collection:**
As per the information provided on Kaggle, the datasets rely on data from the Gallup World Poll to derive happiness scores and rankings. The data collection methodology involves conducting surveys administered by the Gallup World Poll company. These surveys employ the Cantril ladder, wherein individuals are asked to assess their life satisfaction on a scale. Participants are prompted to envision a ladder, with the top rung representing the best possible life (scored as 10) and the bottom rung symbolizing the worst possible life (scored as 0).

**Data Contents:**
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. Gallup World Poll: In 2005, Gallup began its World Poll, which continually surveys citizens in 160 countries, representing more than 98% of the world's adult population. The Gallup World Poll consists of more than 100 global questions as well as region-specific items.
The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.
Ladder score: Happiness score or subjective well-being. This is the national average response to the question of life evaluations.
Logged GDP per capita: The GDP-per-capita time series from 2019 to 2020 using countryspecific forecasts of real GDP growth in 2020.
Social support: Social support refers to assistance or support provided by members of social networks to an individual.
Healthy life expectancy: Healthy life expectancy is the average life in good health - that is to say without irreversible limitation of activity in daily life or incapacities - of a fictitious generation subject to the conditions of mortality and morbidity prevailing that year.
Freedom to make life choices: Freedom to make life choices is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?” ... It is defined as the average of laughter and enjoyment for other waves where the happiness question was not asked
Generosity: Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.
Perceptions of corruption: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”
Ladder score in Dystopia: It has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages. Dystopia as a benchmark against which to compare contributions from each of the six factors. Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. ... Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world's lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom, and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia

**Data Limitations:**

The dataset has several limitations worth noting. Firstly, happiness is inherently subjective and can be influenced by cultural, societal, and individual differences. Therefore, the happiness scores provided may not fully encompass the diverse range of individual experiences within a country. Secondly, there may be concerns regarding data accuracy, as the data is derived from surveys which are susceptible to response biases and inaccuracies. Thirdly, not all countries may have comprehensive data available for all factors included in the report, potentially introducing biases in the analysis. Lastly, the dataset's timeframe is limited, as the most recent report is a few years old, which may not accurately reflect current conditions and trends.
